        Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna
        Kumar Singh and Usha Singh. His father is a retired technical officer
        and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna. He was the
        youngest of five siblings and had the nickname Gulshan. One of his four
        sisters Mitu Singh was a state-level cricket player. He attended the St.
        Karen's High School in Patna. His family moved to Delhi following his
        mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his schooling for
        intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School. Rajput was
        reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and
        won the National Olympiad in Physics. He secured admission in the Delhi
        College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University) to
        pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering.
        According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his
        family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted
        to become an astronaut and later an air force pilot but was also
        interested in Bollywood, being a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. Rajput began his
        acting career after dropping out of his engineering course at the Delhi
        College of Engineering and entering the theatre industry in Mumbai. He
        moved on to feature in Hindi television serials, his debut show was the
        romantic drama Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008), followed by the lead
        role in the soap opera Pavitra Rishta (2009â€“2011). He made his film
        debut with the film adaptation Kai Po Che! (2013) which became a
        critical and commercial success. He followed up with his starring roles
        as a tourist guide in the romantic comedy Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) and
        the titular detective in the action thriller Detective Byomkesh Bakshy.
